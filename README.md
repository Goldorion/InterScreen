# InterScreen
A local network software to share and interact with another computer's screen.
With this small project, you can share one of your monitor's screen on your local network and allow another person to see what you are doing.

## How to use
This can be easily done by starting to share your screen by selecting the local IP address of the computer and by connecting to this same local IP address using another computer.
The port can be changed if needed, but in most cases it is not needed.

## How to get local IP address
To get the local IP address of the "owner" (the computer sharing its screen) on Windows, you can do the following steps:
Go in Parameters -> Network and Internet -> Ethernet -> IPv4 address (e.g. 192.xxx.xx.xxx)

## Java version
This project requires a version of Java equal or higher than Java 17.0.9 in order to work.
